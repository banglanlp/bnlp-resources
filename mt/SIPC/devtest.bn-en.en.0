For a complex number a and b is known as the real and imaginary part respectively.
Through this theorem, with the help of complex number, solution can be obtained of polynomials of one more degree.
The real number 'a' is called the real part of the complex number and the real number b is called the imaginary part of the complex number.
Domain Coloring Process
The Complex Plane or the Zed Plane is used for complex numbers.
Two complex number will be equal if the refer same point on a complex surface.
Any complex number can be written in with the previous addition rule and according to the before said law if we calculate then we get.
Algebraic process.
To be said concretely, for the complex numbers:
Complex Plane and its conjugal is presented geometrically.
Her z and w are any complex number
Addition, multiplication and brackets operations of the complex numbers usually follow the rules of common geometry.
Greater than equal to 0 which is called the extreme value or modulus and φ = arg(z) which is called the argument of z or angle, if r = 0, then z indicates the same point for any value of φ.
(Look Agar function and atan2)
Which is called as exponential form.
If seen Geometrically then the meaning of the equation i2 = -1 is two 90 degree rotation i.e. A 180 degree (pie radian) rotation.Even by this relation (-1)
Set of complex numbers can be expressed this way.

This incident is now known as Hubble's law
IN THE YEAR 1949,ON 28TH MARCH, ""HOWEL"" IN A BBC BROADCAST NAMED ""THIRD PROGRAMME"" DESCRIBED THE THEORY OF ""LAYMETETRE THEORY""AS ""BIG BANG"" WHICH CREATED A LOT OF CONFUSION.
In present time, one of the main topic of astronomical research is emergence and evolution of galaxy in the light of theory of Big Bang.
Depending on the three measures, the age of the universe has been found to be 13.7 ± 0.2 billion years.
When the cosmological expansion stopped, the universe was full of quark-gluon plasma.
Due to this division, the primary forces discussed in Physics get different independent existence.
Sometimes after this, Proton and Neutron united to form the first elements of the universe, the Deuterium and Helium
that is why denser regions attract other substances towards it.
When the expansion of universe is expressed in terms of velocity-distance graph, the line in the graph is not straight-line.
To date, no suitable formula has been invented in physics to explain the situation between 10 and 33 seconds after the big bang.
From this it can easily be understood that this metric will be FRW metric.
Because the amount of comoving distance that light passes during a certain travel is equal to the interim conformal time of that travel.
The light from an object, which has a comoving distance greater than this,can never reach us.
.There are two possible explanation of the observation of Hubble's principle- one is: we exist exactly at the center of the explosion of the galaxy.
It's other name is CMB which is built with photons turned out during the first Baryogenesis.
There was thermal equilibrium present in the early Universe so the spectrum of the radiation was same as radiation in a blackbody spectrum at that time.
In 2003 through the artificial satellite WMAP better quality pictures could be obtained.
7Li/H -for this about 10-9
For this reason the remoter galaxies (those are the ancientest) seem different than the closer ones (those observed in the recent times).
Other than the solved problems there are some more problems, like: Kaspi Halo problem and Cold Invisible element small milky way problem.
The horizon problem
This problem can be solved by cosmological expansion theory.
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child defines a child as ""a human being below the age of 18 years unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier.
But there is no doubt that these are some of the oldest creation in the universe.
Though a huge debate was created by this thing soon after its first invention but the most of the recent-time theologists of the universe are agreed with it.
According to this number the weight of the earth is 30% of the density of the earth's density unit.
According to the data received from WMAP in 2006, 74% of the universe is invisible energy, 22% is invisible matter and only 4% is common matters.
The name of this condition is heat death of Universe.
here inflation index is displayed in the left hand side matrix.

With some religion and from some point of view this information do not matches.
At present the Roman Catholic Church supports the theory of Big Bang and they think that the explanation of the genesis of the Bible is similar to that of Big Bang theory.
As an example in third part of bhagabad Purana (section 10,26) one primitive structure is given in which if you see then it will be bust.

If the density of the earth is less than the transit density then it will maintain the principle of semi-circle geometry, if more than circle and if equal then Euclidio.
Note
There is field formed by the complex number.
Italian mathematician Rafael Bombelli invented the method of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of complex number.
For example, 3+2i is a complex number of which the real part is 3 and imaginary part is 2.
Plot of the function f(x)=(x2-1)(x-2-i)2/(x2+2+2i).
In that case the X-axis is assumed along its real part and Y-axis is assumed along the imaginary part of the number.
Or
i.e.
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division of complex number obey the rule of normal algebraic operation and also it follow the equation.
Positive Identity (“zero”), 0+0i;
Complex Number z can be seen as a vector over the two dimensional Cartesian coordinate system.
WHAT WE GET FROM HERE IS,IF WE DEFINE DISTANCE AT COMPLEX PLAIN THEN THE SET OF COMPLEX NO TURNS INTO A METYRIC SHAPE AND AT THAT TIME WE CAN DEFINE LIMIT AND CONTINUATY.
The summation of two points A and B on a complex plane is    X = A + B is like triangle 0,A,B and triangle X,A,B are congruent.
In this case arg(0) = 0 to get a unique representation.
The obtained result of fie from this equation is in the range (-pie, +pie).
To get the result of multiplication, division in polar form.
The equation(-1) = +1 in geometry can be seen as two 180 degree rotational.
It can be easily learnt that when b=0.
Till then she knows that it is not possible to subtract a big number from a small number.
non Chinese language and some languages are used as second government languages
Some theory is there which we accepted without and proof.
Therefore complex numbers are only as much complex or imaginary as any other real numbers.
Then only this operation will be distributive when a and b will be positive real number.

Besides that, from astronomical point of view, it is investigated  what caused Big Bang and how it occurred.
These three measures are: Estimation of expansion of the universe using ultra new stars of the first type, Estimation of variation in temperature in cosmic microwave background and Estimation of the correlation function of all the milky ways.
Now the scientists probably have produced a substance like this that is known as quark-gluon liquid.
The primary particles were formed during that time, which are still in the same primary stage.
This phenomenon of the creation is called the Big Bang centric process
by this method various stars and other astronomical objects are formed
It is because of invisible energy.
There is no alternative to singularity theory for explaining the situation prior to this difference of state.
These metrics are dependent on a coordinate graph which is spread throughout the time and space and with which we can indicate any point outer space.
From this the causal structure of time and space can be understood.
That means, we cannot influence the whole universe.
.This observation can not be supported if the theory of Copernican is accepted.
Since thermal equity was existing in the early universe, so the radiation heat and quantity of plasmas were same before the plasmas became united again.
Later according to Hubble's law, temperature started to reduce due to red shifting and omission was seen in the behavior of blackbody.
Through this few of the cosmic inflation models proved to be wrong.
All this ratio can be told before with the help of a single number.
Moreover, the galaxies which were created lately, they are usually different though they are remoter.
But this problems are not much conflicting with the Big Bang theory.
The horizon problem arose from the concept that information can't travel faster than light.

According to this theory due to the movement of the branes of the string theory the expansion takes place; the pre-Big Bang model, ekpyrotic model in which the collision among the branes is considered to be the reason of the Big Bang and cyclic model.
Some information cannot be determined by the scientist with the Big Bang Theory, and some definition needs to be questioned due to the Big Bang theory (first theory).
All sects of the Rabbinic Judaism have accepted this theory.
In Universe there is no starting and no end.
However at present time efforts are being made to prove these.
no other idea about that
The earth will surely from its primitive form have to stay from one part of 1015 part of the transit density.
Relation with outside and Informatic facts
Therefore we can use the four algebraic operations:summation, subtraction, multiplication and division on it.
Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton extended this abstraction of complex number into a theorem.
If z=a+b then the real part a is expressed as Re(z) or ℜ(z) and the imaginary part b is expressed as lm(z) or ℑ(z).
With any color the argument of the function and with the densified shadow the value of the functon is shown.
From here it can easily be understood that every complex number of the form is actually a point along the X-axis of the complex plane and at the same time they are individual real numbers as well.
Definition of the result of their multiplication and addition is:
Now if we think real number x in the form of (x,0) then we see that the equation (y,0) is actually made by the multiplication of the full part of z (0,y) with the real number (0,1).
Addition:

This operations of the polar form is much easier than that of the Cartesian form.
If C is a complex number and n is a positive whole number then if a complex number z satisfies the equation zn = c then z is called as the nth root of c.
Historically the theory of complex number developed much later than that of real numbers.
As an example, she is shown the number of balls in a bag or the number of bananas in a bunch of bananas.
chinese language or bai hawa in the starting of twenty century is known as monderen language's written virtual message
But only from this observation they are not able to solve real problem.
Hence  complex numbers are complex, imaginary, - without going into all these literally, the real picture of complex numbers that can be arrived at are:
so this equation is not pure.

Quark and Gluon unitedly form Baryons, such as, Proton and Neutron.
The process of cooling of the universe continued; at one point of time the relative speed that existed between the particles of matters as a result of this procedure, decreased
but this process is not so simple
Therefore, because of this energy, when the distance is very large, the velocity of that body increases much more than normal.
According to the theory of gravity by Einstein, an anti-gravitational point has been imagined at the most initial point of the explosion.
In this respect the particular graph is the Comoving coordinate system.
For example: the Big Bang was occurred at a definite conformal time of antiquity.
That means, it also has a future horizon.
The other explanation is: as religiously balanced place-period,the universe is expanding all over at one rate.
Before the formation of atom, radiation was emitted and absorbed in phases permanently which is called Compton dispersion.
Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson accidentally discovered the background radiation in 1964.
However, its data supported the basic model of cosmic inflation.
The set number is the ratio of Barrian and Futon.
It means that the time of the creation of the universe is becoming the driving factor, the key of which is the evolution.
The Big Bang theory has given birth to many problems that we are unable to do that much experiment on earth to give any proper answer to it.
It is learnt that if the distance between two points in the universe located far apart is more than the product of speed of light and age of the universe, no causal connection between them can ever exist.

These operations are the general form of the operations deal with the real numbers.
He elevated the theory of complex number into the theory of quaternions.
The whole set of the complex numbers is represented by the symbol C.

In this way if we move to the positive and negative sides along the X-axis we could find each number of R, that is each of the real numbers.
By
i.e. this (0,1) is only the imaginary unit which from now onwards we will express by that.
Subtraction:
Reverse Positive, e.g; - Reverse Positive of a+bi is -a -bi;
That's why the Complex number z is thought as a point in the cartesian coordinate, so the x of cartesian coordinate = Re (z)is x axis and in the same way y=im(z) is y axis.
From diagram we see that with respect to x axis the reflection of z so and both are real numbers.
The bracket of a point A is complex X = A* is such a point like the reflection of triangle 0,1,A and triangle 0,1,X of each other on the x axis.
If r > 0 then in the argument in φ module is 2n; a unique one.

From 1990 onwards, research related to Big Bang has eased out a lot.
This model can beautifully describe everything within the universe.
At some point of space and time, some reaction in this substance takes place that is not yet properly known to men.
As the quantity of quark increases slightly than anti-quark, quantity of baryon increases slightly than anti-baryon too.
Two types of forces were concentrated in these particles; the stationary potential energy and the radiation energy
this is based on the type and amount of substances of that region
Therefore, greater the distance, greater is the increase of velocity.
It has been said that at this point, the density was infinite.
The lines of this graph expand in the same rate and in the same direction as the way this universe is expanding.
Let this conformal time.
Observational Evidence
This observation was made long before Hubble presented his theory.
That means, early universe was opaque to light.
That time they were conducting diagnostic observations using a new microwave receiver owned by Bell Laboratories.
Abundance of primeval elements
This discovery is quiet stable for 7Li and 4He; because for this two element it is very unstable to say about it.
These observations are completely against the theory of constant state.
Among this are the invisible power, invisible element powerful stability etc and the problems are from here.
The isotropy observation of cosmological microwave background radiation has created more problems because the size of horizon of this time is almost equal to 2 degree part of the universe.
The issue why the amount of anti matter is more than matter is not yet understood.
children behaviour
In 1970 and 1980 it is proved by various observations that the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies is very high and it is not possible to supply this strength by the visible matter in the Universe.
During the month of August of 2006 through the observation of collision among the bullet cluster galaxies, the scientists became certain about the presence of the dark matters.
These relationships are more based upon the foundation of adjustments, compromises, and sacrifices and a liking for each other which blossoms into love.
If mass density of the universe is more than the critical density, the universe will initially start expanding and on reaching a certain point it will start contracting again.
It is not known what can happen due to this.
in past the time which we have assumed to be the start of inflation , knowledge about that is very limited.
Chaotic expansion, according to which the expansion for the universe was started by some chaotic conditions.
According to some people the Big Bang theory makes conflict with the everyday's belief.
Islamic Religion
According to this religion Universe goes under unexpected expansion, Saturation, and Destruction.
Isotropy of the universe which by defining the universal idealogy has measured it 10-5 degree in pure form, while constructing the bigger extent of universe only 10% homogenous purity is found.
and no other things and topics
As an solution to these problems came up the stability theory of the earth.
About this there is a list in the study books to see, look: elemental universal information
A complex number can be thought as an ordered pair of two real numbers, which actually indicates a vector in the Argand plane.
But when it is used on the complex numbers, some extra features are seen from these operations.
Complex numbers are used in a number of engineering fields including Electromagnetism, Quantum Physics, Applied mathematics, chaos theory.
R, the set of real numbers, can be said to be a sub-set of C, the set of complex numbers, where the real numbers are those complex numbers whose imaginary part is zero.
Two complex numbers are said to be equal to each other if and only if both the real and the imaginary parts are equal.
It means that we can assume this X-axis to be the number line as known to us.
These two operation will be on two complex number which are completely different from two real number.
Now, in the form (x,0) can be written as only x and we get:
Multiplication:
For each and every non zero complex number there must be a multiplicative reverse e.g; there is multiplicative reverse of  a+bi.
One complex number presented in the cartesian form is known as the number's cartesian form or rectangular form or algebric form.
With the complex number and their opposite there are some funny laws.
With the help of these geometric interpretations the geometric problems are transformed into algebraic (here the term algebra is a little different from the common algebra) problems and in the same way the algebraic problems can be considered as geometric problems and can be solved.
That it, if the argument difference of any two complex number being the multiple of 2n, then they are considered as equivalent.
Then we have to add 2pie from the obtained value of fie from the equation.
And
We can get this nth term if we write c in the calculation where r>0 and fie, is a real number then nth root set of C is
Where one of the solutions is as if.
Then she can imagine this fraction or decimal number with the distance travelled or other examples.
clasic chinese still also is the part of lesson in high school and mostly part of degrees also
Like that we also use complex number to solve quantum mechanics, quantum physics, quantum electro dynamics and many higher mathematics, science and in thousands of field.
Complex numbers are indispensible for solving many important and real problems.
If a negative sign comes under a square root then this negative sign must be written in some form so that this sign will not come in next operation.
A complex plane is used in analytical systems like root locus, Nyquist plot and Nicol plot etc.
For example, absolute value in complex representation of a Sine wave of fixed frequency.
This mathematical used to analysis of alternating current and voltage with the help of impedence, is called Phasor Calculus.

At the primordial state the universe was uniform and equally hot, filled with a matter having high energy density and high temperature and pressure.
Due to this reaction the law of conservation for baryons is violated and the number of quarks and leptons minutely increase compared to their anti-elements.
No new proton/anti-proton pair can form below a particular temperature.
As a result of the diminished relative speed the concentration of the stationary potential energy became dominant over the concentration of radiation energy.
there might had been three types of substances.
Considering a general assumption, the amount of this invisible energy comes as a universal constant in Einstein's field equation, even though it has not been possible to explore the nature of this energy yet.
To solve this physical puzzle, a quantum gravity theory is needed.
As a result the coordinate of a certain astronomical object remains constant all the time.
Now, for those objects who have the comoving distance more than this, their distance is so long that light cannot reach to us from there.
Three observations and experiments are cited as the evidence of the universal theory of Big Bang.
Then observation was made on the basis of the general  comparative theory.
However, as the universe was expanding, at the same time it became cool slowly and at one stage the temperature came down below 3000 Kelvin.
The radiation they discovered was isotropic and consistent with a blackbody spectrum; its temperature was about 3 Kelvin.
By using the Big Bang model, the ratio of ordinary Hydrogen present in the universe with Helium-8, Helium-3, Deuterium and Helium-7 can be measured
Whatever, a clear prove against the primitive Big Bang Theory; because with no other theory than the Big Bang it can be proved.
Problems and other important matters
This are solution less problems of Physical Science.
If the universe expanded equally after Plank's epoch, the temperature of these regions would not have been equal.
It is thought that when the universe was young and was very hot it maintained statistical equilibrium that is in it the number of baryons was just equal to that of anti baryons.
Many see such isolation of child characters from supporting adults as necessary preparation for the transition to adulthood. The school story became a common device for this, beginning with Tom Brown's Schooldays
That means, it is more powerful compared to particular objects.
To identify the dark matters is almost impossible.
Bengali marriages are a mixture of pure custom,  tradition and religious beliefs
Then it will begin to be more dense and hot and at some point will reach the initial stage when the great contraction started.
In the Lambda-CDM model of the universe invisible power is shown as a cosmic constant.
there might be lots of things outside the world picture that has been portrayed from the various theories.
Many among these often get mixed up with one another.
The maker Scientist Hugh Ross thinks that the Big Bang Theory gives support to the theory of Nihilo.
The modern thinkers of the religion of Islam are in the opinion that the the proposition of Quran is just similar to the theory of Big Bang and a scientific explanation can also be found in Quran.
According to this philosophy you cannot disagree Universe, though the logic has been accepted.
At present efforts of measuring the Copernican ideology is on.

Here, the vector (a,b) is indicating the complex number a+ib.
For example, we can get negative real numbers from squaring of some complex(imaginary) numbers.
in some cases it can be identified from the name also that there are use  of complex number in the internal mathematical construction.
That is, the real part a can be thought of.
In other words, two complex numbers and will be equal to each other if and only if and happens.
Therefore, it is clear to us that every point of the number line is infact included with the complex plane.

from the calculation of a complete number we can get,
With this usual real number of r is denoted by positive integer of n.
This is our familiar imaginary unit which relegates theory of mathematics to concern itself with set of complex numbers from that of real numbers.
For example, a person has travelled 1½ km distance.

That is, complex numbers are not un-real.
Addition.
For example, it is especially important in root locus system whether all the poles and the zeroes in a complex plane are located on the left half plane or right half plane (i.e. whether real part of the root is greater than or smaller than zero).
Amplitude and with argument phase is represented.

Among these the most dangerous was the atomic bomb.
But there is a common consideration on this which is mostly acceptable.
The war of Kobrin (17th September, 1939)--The march of the Second Motorized Division of Germany in the map and the retreat of Poland, the Second World War started with the attack of the Nazis on Poland.

As per the theory of the Big Bang, the universe was created from a highly dense drop.
The explanation about the structure of the ancientest objects of the universe can be derived through this for which the Alpher-Bethe-Gamow theory was propounded just after the theory of Big Bang.

There are two different possibilities.
APART FROM THESE TWO SKETCHES OF ""HOWEL"" AND ""LAYMETRER"", SEVERAL MORE SKETCHES WERE PRESENTED OF THE UNIVERSE.
Presently people have powerful telescope like Kobe, Hubble space telescope and WMAP.
Laws of physics became applicable after 10-43 seconds of formation of the universe.
That is, there occurs a small excess of quarks and leptons over anti-quarks and anti-leptons.
Simultaneously annihilation of mass starts within the remaining proton and anti-proton.
Almost 380, 000 years after the Big Bang, the electron and the nucleus united to form atoms; among these mainly hydrogen atoms were formed.
from the satellite wmp some evidences show that the amount of invisible cold substances is maximum about 80%
It can be said that lots of observation and research on both theoretical and practical field of relation between equation of state of this energy and structure of conventional particle physics have still to be done.
At present, compiling a modern-age theory to understand this subject is the biggest unsolved problem in physics.
Even if the comoving distance and the coordinate distance are same of any two points in the space, the physical distance of these comoving points increases proportionally with the scale factor of the universe.
So that we would never be able to see the whole part of the old universe.
These are: Hubble-type expansion accepted after observing the red shift of galaxies,the comprehensive measurement of the cosmic microwave background, and abundance of light elements.
This observation is recognized as the basic foundation of the theory of great explosion till today.
Nucleon and electron united and formed atom.
This discovery stands in favor of the Big Bang hypothesis and brought Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson the Nobel Prize.
Abundance of these elements mainly depends on the ratio of photons and baryons.
Miraculously it is seen that in the new Universe the Helium content is more than the Deuterium or Helium (3He) is smaller than the Deuterium and its always keeps its ratio constant.
Though almost most all the researchers now agree with the theory of the Big Bang, it was not like this at one time.
For the solution of this a independent experiment with Big Bang, and by releasing main stream of light and then studying it and study with the most new stars.
Equation problem
But now it has been proved through observation that almost whole of the observable universe is made up of matter.
A literary genre is a category of literary composition. Genres may be determined by technique, tone, content, or length. Nancy Anderson, associate professor in the College of Education at the University of South Florida in Tampa
After that the scientists had to accept the idea that, 90% of the universe is not normal baryonic matter but they are Dark matter.
Because the gravitational effects of these matters are not exactly understood.
From this only came the thought of invisible power.
On the other hand, if the density is equal to or less than the critical density, at some point of time the expansion will slow down but will never come to an end.
It is said in this theory, that only the gravitationally limited objects of the universe, such as galaxy, will stay together. However, heat death of them will happen as well due to expansion and freezing of the universe.
Form the inflation index we assume that the indexing expansion has made the whole universe has moved out from the scope of observation
But the basic principles of it have not yet been clearly proved.
A result for various information regarding the Big Bang Theory is given over here:

And for these reason only it was said that if the stability theory is accepted then the earth must be taken as an absolute plain.
Information helping in experiment
In mathematics, a complex number is regarded as a mathematical extension of a real number.
Complex numbers were first conceived by the Italian mathematician Gerolamo Cardano, during his attempts to find solutions to cubic equations.
Like, Complex Analysis, Complex matrix, Complex polynomial and Complex Lie algebra.
The complex numbers of which the real part is zero are called imaginary numbers and instead of that, they are denoted only by.
Operation
From here it is clearly seen that.
Just it is known that.
Now we notice that,
Where either the value of c and d is not equal to zero.
When every real numbers a is expressed as a+0i, R the field of real numbers constitutes a sub field of complex field C.
One complex number's modulus value can be calculated this way.
If and only if z is only imaginary i.e. the real part of z is zero.
Where the solutions of the equation represent the points on sides of those 17 sided polygon.
Then this argument is called the principal argument.
Polar Form is generally revealed
From there we can get,
If C=0, then nth root will be only zero.
Introduction of ambiguity
After that, she gets introduced with negative number during learning of algebra.
chinese currencies also are in majority which are written in modern language which is chinese word and han hopenion which is freom roman words tibetin which is from tibbati words yugor with arabic words mangolian traditionally with mangolian words are written
At the beginning of learning algebra like a student ask "" wat is the meaning of this equation?""
Literally
""Real"" and ""imaginary"" is two meaning full word when complex number is represented as only a real number.
If all the poles of a system,
Where, z is the representation of Sine wave in complex number.

This universe was formed out of a highly dense and hot state before 13.7 billion year from now.
An important consequence of the big bang is that the present state of the universe is completely different from its past and future states.
which is protecting them from being safe and to be ready to see all the activities of the enemies from one place to another place
One is the static state hypothesis by Fred Hoyle, which states that, when the universe starts expanding, then new matters may start forming here.

All these observations are made connected by universal lambda-CDMA equation.
The basic foundation of the theory
If we explain the universe with these coordinates we would find that the big bang was not meant for filling up the hollow spaces of the universe, rather the space is itself expanding and consequently the physical distances of the comoving points have been increased.
From this that the idea of horizon of the past was originated.
On top of that, the observational correlation function, which is involved in the creation of the vast extent of the universe,goes well with the ideal theory of Big Bang.
This proposal was made by Fredman-Lemaitro-Robertson-Walker.
At the same time the early age plasmas converted into a inactive gas.
In 1989, NASA sent a satellite named Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE) to explore the background radiation.

In its solution it has been stated that this asymmetry was created by an unknown process called baryogenesis.
A much-overlooked kind of children's literature is work written by children and young teens, such as The Young Visiters by Daisy Ashford (aged nine)
Before that the thinking was that all matters in the universe are normal which we can see and observe.
Till today, the direct observation of the dark matters has not yet been possible from any of the observatories of the world.
It is thought that the remaining 70% of this strength is made by it.
The more the universe will expand its density will decrease and as a result of which no new starts will form.
Another theory is Phantom Power theory.
We can have detailed knowledge of what has happened during that time when we will understand the heavy powered physics theories

According to the great contraction theory it was predicted that, in the universe there are many spot errors which can be expressed as much denser magnetic mono polarization than the normal observation.
Every complex number can be written in this form where a and b are real numbers.
This ultimately led to the fundamental theorem of algebra.
A complex number is shown in generalized form where a and b are real numbers and is imaginary unit, which follows the formula.
So complex number are sometimes found to be written as.

The then impartial Bulgaria and Yugoslavia took turns.
But throughout the war the Cetnik party under the leadership of Draza Mihajlovic and the Communist party under the leadership of Joseph Tito continued a guerrilla war fare.
Google's target is to avail and arrange all the information of the world and make those accessible to public.
It has been explained through the Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker model of the general theory of relativity.
History
many things are still visible when nothing is going to be shown
This theopry by Lemaître was named by Hoyle.
IN THE YEAR 1964  POST"" COSMIC MOLECULAR WAVE REFLECTION"" THEORY WAS DISCOVERED AND PRESENTED, THE ""BING BANG"" THEORY BECAME MOST IMPORTANT THEORY TO EXPLAIN THE CREATION OF EARTH AND ITS GRADUAL ADAPTATION.

Basically from this time exponential expansion of the universe began.
During fall of temperature, at some point of time transition phase occurs, as a result of which symmetrical braking takes place.
The incident happens for electron and anti-electron or positron in more low temperature.
But in this also there were some discrepancies.
the 70% density of universe is due to this substance.
At that time, the energy of the particles was so large that it is very not possible to perform a realistic experiment in present day perspective.
Cosmological Principle
The conformal coordinate is quite important.
Though this conformal time is extreme infinite in comparison with our clocks and which is called the proper time.
Observation of distant galaxies and quasars show that they exhibit the red shift--The wavelengths of the light emitted by them shift to comparatively longer wavelengths.
The theory of great explosion told about the background of the existence of little ripple diffusion.
As a result, radiation emitted from the matter were free to travel the whole universe without any obstruction.
It was also found that out of each 150 portion, one portion of CMB is isotropic.
10-4 for 3 He/H
The age of the Milky Ways are increasing slowly and with it is increasing there pathways.
Of late these arguments are seen from the historical point of view since the theory of Big Bang has been popular; to solve them a lot changes have been made in this theory and every now and then some developed experimentation have also been made.
Some important problems and some informative facts are defined here:
Generally the universe can have three geometries: parabolic geometry, Euclidean geometry or elliptical geometry.
These conditions state that the universe must contain such  number of baryons that is not reserved, must violate C-symmetry and CP-asymmetry and it must be apart from thermal equilibrium.
Many authors work with a preferred artist who illustrates their words; others create books together, and some illustrators write their own books.
There is no other way than accepting the dark matter idea to solve this problem.
In the 1990s an extensive figure of the actual mass density of the universe was published.
But in order to understand this subject experiments are going on at present also.
While increasing entropy of the universe will reach such a   point that no organized power can be obtained from it.
A graphical presentation of the expansion of universe.
The Hutrol- Hawking theory and other similar kind of theories has assumed the place and time as limit.
Again, many have found dissimilarities as well.
Pope Miyan 12 was a good supporter of the Big Bang Theory, thought this information is never proved scientifically.
Some theists of the Hindu religion, like Vaishnab religion, supports the theory of the Big Bang.
