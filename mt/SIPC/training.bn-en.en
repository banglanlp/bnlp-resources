Nixon feared that an Indian invasion of West Pakistan would mean total Soviet domination of the region, and that it would seriously undermine the global position of the United States and the regional position of America's new tacit ally, China.

For example, in a theory it is assumed that all other things remaining the same, a higher educated person will earn more than a person with lower education.
It also studies how a producer maximizes his profit taking into consideration his constraints (demand for normal goods, technology and cost of factors).
.It also discusses the efforts of the producers to maximize their profit taking into consideration their own obstacles(demand for better products,technology and cost of production).
Marginalists mentioned opportunity cost to measure trade off condition.
. The new-Keynesian economics is also related to the development of Keynesian systems.
Neo Keynesian economics is also related to the development of the Keynesian tradition.
there are many businesses which are runnning well but not making the most as they have to look forward in the time
Thereafter over a long period human, human activities and the issues of human welfare continued to be included in the definition as was not he case with wealth.
.Subsequently for a long time the subject of human,humane works and human welfare started to be included in the definition more than the inclusion of wealth.
Rationality = Own preference: It is regarded as a generally accepted principle and many mainstream economists believe that rationality includes own choice and issues like this.
Logicality = Self desire is considered as an ordinary first principle and many mainstream economists believes that, logicality, self desire and such subjects are also included.
. Logicality = Individual-liking: It may be considered as a general principle and many mainstream economists believe that logicality individual-liking also include this type of subjects.

Because of that in order to maintain professionalism,it is imperative to be a member of the technology related institutions,to be well informed about the latest position in one's own field and maintaining the habit of acquiring continuous knowledge.
and nothing is remaining for the later so kindly think for your family also
So, for the interest of maintaining the professionalism, becoming members of the technical organizations, keeping oneself aware of the magazines of his own field and acquiring the work related knowledge are very important
So in the interest of maintaining professional standard, it is  highly needed to become a member of technological institutes, to be aware about the magazines of in one's own area and to gather knowledge on continuous basis.
For example, for an electrical engineer whose area is VLSI (IC design work), the Quantum force science and the Solid State Physics is very important; but a person who works with bigger scale electrical equipments these are not at all important for him.
As example, quantum mechanics and solid state physics are very useful for those whose work field is VLSI (the design of integrated circuits) but these are useless for those working on electrical tools for large machineries.
For example,an electrical engineer whose area of work is VLSI (integrated circuit or IC designing) requires knowledge of quantum mechanics and solid state physics in day to day affairs while one who works with large sized electrical equipments not at all need them.
For example,an electrical engineer whose sphere of work is VLSI(mixed circuit or IC designing work) quantum ball science and hard temperament physics are always necessary but it is totally unnecessary for someone who works with large electrical machinery.
In the work field the electrical engineers often have to supervise the work of scientists, electricians, computer programmer or other technicians of different occupations.

May be included as a new alternative developments: environmental economics,change related economics,dependent economics,structural economics and the theory of evolution of world.
Which can be included in new alternative developments: environmental economics, economics of change, economics of dependence, structural economics and world process theory.
if you maintain that so you will get the good and great reward not for the small but also large
Sometimes what is being stated in other social sciences on the same issue, it becomes difficult for the economists to conduct regular experiments in standard and practical aspects of human related issues.
Sometimes it becomes difficult for the economists to examine regularly the humane related principles and utilization in the face of the viewpoints of other social sciences on the same subject.
Propensity to increase income = consumption: It is treated as an accepted principle and many mainstream economists think that men are happy with consumption and unhappy without it.
Sometimes this accepted first principle is a subject of various tests and also a subject of the unselfish first principle, when all social pressures are considered or when reaction to self desire is calculated.
......Tendency of increase of income = Appropriations: It may be considered as an accepted principle and many mainstream economists believe that human beings are happy when they enjoy and unhappy without enjoyment.
As an example, in 21st century US democracy make it possible to combine the development process, the contribution of Karl Marx in 19th century or the cold war upon the debate of capitalism vs socialism is a considerable subject of economics.
As examples, US made   the developmental activities of the republic possible in the 21st century, the contribution of Karl Marx, or the cold war involving the controversy between the capitalism and socialism, are matters of discussion of economics
As an example it can be stated that in 21st century US democracy enabled synchronization of development process, in 19th century contribution of Karl Marx or the cold war around the debate of socialism versus capitalism is the subject of economics.
The early assumption of human consumption is that when one decides on buying, then he definitely will consider the humanitarian ground and the environment, and also the monetary and business economics.
to maintain the lifestyle nothing is good and nothing is bad they think like this
The previous presumptions for humane consumptions are that a person must take into consideration the humane and environmental ideas when deciding to buy and apart from that also consider economic and commercial principles.

Social science is a science of observation or sometimes science, it is a debated issue of twentieth century.
Social science is an observational science or sometime science, and a subject of controversy in the twentieth century.
For issues that are not able to satisfy other assumed conditions can be added which never can satisfy human beings.
Tendency of income increase = Consumption can be considered as an agreed first principle and many mainstream economist maintain this belief that human species are happy in consumption and unhappy when denied consumption
Other general hypothetical terms of the subject that not capable of making happy may be added which are never be able to make human being happy.
Still, economics do not create any cost complaint, so it may be a cause that, economics forecast without relying on observation-based research and a corollary examination.
Apart from these, economics does not make any complaint regarding the price, as a result, it may be one of the reasons that economics forecasts without any observational research or experimentations
Even after that economics does not create any price attack and it may be a cause that economics gives forecasts without observational research and empirical verification.
On the other hand, logical limited distribution of wealth fulfils the gap of an aspect of general welfare and economics
but the king of that time felt that his people are misusing himand they
On the other hand, distribution of reasonable limited resources fulfills the shortage in general welfare and in one of the economic field.

Though the basic ideology is over simplified (though many modern representatives of economists may not believe), now empirical verification assures this relationship of the concept of tendency to increase income and factors of income.
It is possible to add those not able to satisfy with other ordinary conditions which cannot ever keep humans happy.  Although the main ideology is more problematic (most of the representatives of the economists cannot believe at the current time), at presents observation-based exam can determine the relationship between the tendency of income rise and other constituents of income.
Though, more simplicity of main principles are problematic(most of the representatives of the economists of present days may not even believe),at present the observational experiments ensures the relationship between the idea of the tendency of increase of income and this type of elements of income.
As a social science, economics try to focus the performance of  other economic systems without observing results and evaluation and necessary structure of same process.
